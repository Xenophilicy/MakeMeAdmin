## Information
With this plugin, you can very easily switch your group from **PurePerms** with a simple command that pops a UI onto your screen thanks to integration of **FormAPI**! All you do from there is select which group you want to switch to, and voila! This plugin also uses permission nodes to determine which groups should popup for which players, depending on which nodes are added to your group or player file. The ones not available, show as "Locked" and are grayed out in the UI. Each rank has an assigned permission node that can be edited in the config.yml.
