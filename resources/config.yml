VERSION: "1.6.0" # Internal use only

# You can use this toggle to allow players who are opped to switch to any rank they desire
# WARNING: Setting this option to true will allow every opped player to bypass all permissions and switch to ANY RANK!
OP-Bypass: false

# Choose whether to report group changes to the console
# An example of this inside the console:
# [MakeMeAdmin] Xenophilicy has changed their group to Moderator
Report-Rank-Change: true

Messages:

  # Here you can customize the message that is sent in CONSOLE when a player changes groups
  # {player} → Player's name placeholder
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  Console-Report: "§b{player} §ehas changed their group to {group}"

  # Here you can customize the message that is sent to the PLAYER when they change their rank
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  Player-Report: "§aYou have selected {group} §r§a as your rank!"

  # This is the message that is sent to a player when they choose a rank that they already have
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  Current-Rank: "§eYour rank is already set to {group}§r§e!"

  # This is the message that is sent to a player when they try to switch to a non-existent rank
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  No-Exists: "§cThe rank {group} doesn't exist!"

  # This is the message that is sent to a player when they don't have permission for a particular rank
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  No-Rank: "§cYou don't have permission to switch to {group}§r§c!"

  # This is the message that is sent to a player when they don't have permission to use the UI
  No-Switch: "§cYou don't have permission to switch ranks!"

Command:

  # This is the prefix that users must put before their rank name when switching with commands
  # For example: using `/rank Owner` will switch your group to owner (As listed in the examples)
  # This also applies to the UI, for example: using `/rank` will simply open the rank UI
  Prefix: "/rank"

  # This is the description of the command that will show next to the command name in the command windows in-game
  Description: "Easily switch your rank"

  Permission:

    # This is a setting that you can set to false to allow everyone access to the UI
    # It is recommended you keep this false because anyone, regardless if they have a rank perm, can open the UI
    Require: false

    # This is the master permission node for all MakeMeAdmin rank commands
    # All users who are allowed to use the command/open the UI must have this node
    Node: rank.switch

UI:

  # This is the title of the rank UI
  Title: "§6Server Ranks"

  # This is the message that will show under your title on the rank UI
  Message: "§aPick the rank to switch to!"

Group:

  # Choose what group manager you're using for your server
  # PurePerms has the most support for the plugin and is the default dependency
  # Other managers don't use direct API calls and therefore may be less reliable
  Manager: PurePerms

  # Command string used to change groups
  # This has no effect if you're using PurePerms
  # Available arguments:
  # {player} → Player's name placeholder
  # {group} → Group name placeholder
  Command-String: "setgroup {player} {group}"

# Every rank added needs a label, alias, and permission:
# Label → The label will be the text you see in the UI
# Alias → The alias is the name of the group in your groups.yml file
# PermissionString → Permission node required to switch to the rank

# You can use '§' or '&' in the labels for colors and effects to show up on the UI
# For images, use 'url' or 'path' to show an image in the menus (or leave blank to disable)
# Note: If you are using a URL, do NOT include the 'https://' or 'http://' in the link!
# Add as many ranks as you'd like using this format → Label:Alias:Permission:ImageType:Path/URL
