VERSION: "1.6.0" # Internal use only

# You can use this toggle to allow players who are opped to switch to any rank they desire
# WARNING: Setting this option to true will allow every opped player to bypass all permissions and switch to any rank!
Bypass-OP: false

# This is the prefix that users must put before their rank name when switching with commands
# For example: using `/rank Owner` will switch your group to owner (As listed in the examples)
# This also applies to the UI, for example: using `/rank` will simply open the rank UI
Command-Prefix: "rank"

# Command string used to change groups (Leave default if you're using PurePerms)
# Available arguments:
# {player} → Player's name placeholder
# {group} → Group name placeholder
Group-Set-String: "setgroup {player} {group}"

# Every rank added needs a label, alias, and permission:
# Label → The label will be the text you see in the UI
# Alias → The alias is the name of the group in your groups.yml file
# PermissionString → Permission node required to switch to the rank

# You can use '§' or '&' in the labels for colors and effects to show up on the UI
# For images, use 'url' or 'path' to show an image in the menus (or leave blank to disable)
# Note: If you are using a URL, do NOT include the 'https://' or 'http://' in the link!
# Add as many ranks as you'd like using this format → Label:Alias:Permission:ImageType:Path/URL
